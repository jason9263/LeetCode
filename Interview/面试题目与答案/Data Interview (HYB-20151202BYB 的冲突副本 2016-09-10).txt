polynomial regression and feature transformation (for non-linear problems); alternatively: decision trees and random forests (advantages and shortcomings), support vector regression

How do you measure fit of the model? What do R and D mean?What is Ordinary Least Squares? What are some possible problems with regression models? How do you avoid or compensate for them?

Name a few types of regression you are familiar with? What are the differences?

What is overfitting a regression model? What are ways to avoid it?

In linear regression, under what condition R^2 always equals a perfect 1?
